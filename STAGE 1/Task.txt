Team Instructions:
Feel free to maintain your team.
If you prefer to work solo, still go ahead
If you want to switch teams, please let your current team know before you exit.
You can now increase your team population to a maximum of 6
As usual, you can decide to use Python or R, even within a team, but:
You have to submit them differently.
You have to provide all 4 functions for each language when submitting
Deadline: Sunday, 15th Feb.
Functions Galore!
Write a function for translating DNA to protein
Write a function that simulates and generates a logistic population growth curve. Your function should include 2 extra parameters that randomize the length of the lag phase and the exponential phase [See population curve here] . Most living populations follow a logistic population growth. Therefore, your growth curve can be: Population Size vs Time, Cell density vs Time, OD vs Time, CFU vs Time, etc
Using your function, generate a dataframe with 100 different growth curves
Write a function for determining the time to reach 80% of the maximum growth; usually the carrying capacity
Finally, write a function for calculating the hamming distance between your Slack username and twitter/X handle (synthesize if you donâ€™t have one). Feel free to pad it with extra words if they are not of the same length.
