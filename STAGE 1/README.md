# ðŸš€ HackBio_Coding_Internship - #Team Leucine
#Stage 1 Task

ðŸ“ŒTask Instructions:
1. Write a function for translating DNA to protein
2. Write a function that simulates and generates a logistic population growth curve. Your function should include 2 extra parameters that randomize the length of the lag phase and the exponential phase. Most living populations follow a logistic population growth. Therefore, your growth curve can be: #Population Size vs Time, Cell density vs Time, OD vs Time, CFU vs Time, etc#
3. Using your function, generate a dataframe with 100 different growth curves. Write a function for determining the time to reach 80% of the maximum growth; usually the carrying capacity
4. Finally, write a function for calculating the hamming distance between your Slack username and twitter/X handle.

ðŸ“šThe tasks cover the following concepts in Python:

- Conditionals (if, elif and else statements)
- Loops which aid iteration of codes (For Loop)
- Functions which are needed to pass data and can be called anytime it is needed while scripting.
