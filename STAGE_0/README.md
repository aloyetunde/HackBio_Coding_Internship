# ðŸš€ HackBio_Coding_Internship - **#Team Leucine**

**#Stage 0 Task**

ðŸ“Œ**Task Instructions**
 Using either R or Python (We used Python!), use any data structure of your choice to organize the following information:
 Names, Slack username, Email, Hobby, Countries, Discipline and Preferred programming language.
 - No functions, loops, conditionals or any complex concepts.
 - Final print statement should print the organized output in a logical and understandable way.
 - Finally, create a simple video tutorial that includes all your team mates. Publish the video on linkedin. 

ðŸ“šThe tasks covers the following Basics of Python:
 1. Python Syntax
 2. Python Data Types
 3. Data Structures

**âœ…Task Implementation**
We wrote a simple script to present the details of all team members in a structured tabular form. To achieve this; 
- We first created lists to be the header for the table and the required information were stored in each list as strings.
- A varaible named "dataframe" was then created by making use of the f-string which allows for interpolation of variables and operations in a string.
- The items in each string were accessed making use of their indexes and arranged making use of dashes and strokes to achieve a tabular format.
- The final step was to print (dataframe).
