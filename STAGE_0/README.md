# ðŸš€ HackBio_Coding_Internship - **#Team Leucine**

**#Stage 0 Task**

ðŸ“Œ**Task Instructions**
1.  Write a function for translating DNA to protein
2.  Write a function that simulates and generates a logistic population growth curve. Your function should include 2 extra parameters that randomize the length of the lag phase and the exponential phase Most living populations follow a logistic population growth. Therefore, your growth curve can be: Population Size vs Time, Cell density vs Time, OD vs Time, CFU vs Time, etc
3. Using your function, generate a dataframe with 100 different growth curves. Write a function for determining the time to reach 80% of the maximum growth; usually the carrying capacity
4. Finally, write a function for calculating the hamming distance between your Slack username and twitter/X handle (synthesize if you donâ€™t have one). Feel free to pad it with extra words if they are not of the same length.

ðŸ“šThe tasks covers the following concepts in Python:
 1. Python Syntax
 2. Python Data Types
 3. Data Structures

**âœ…Task Implementation**
We wrote a simple script to present the details of all team members in a structured tabular form. To achieve this; 

- We firstly collect the information of every member of the team as seen below:
  

- We created lists to be the header for the table and the required information were stored in each list as strings.
- A varaible named "dataframe" was then created by making use of the f-string which allows for interpolation of variables and operations in a string.
- The items in each string were accessed making use of their indexes and arranged making use of dashes and strokes to achieve a tabular format.
- The final step was to print (dataframe).
