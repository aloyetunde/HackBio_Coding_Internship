#Stage 0 Task

ðŸ“ŒTask Instructions Using either R or Python (We used Python!), use any data structure of your choice to organize the following information: Names, Slack username, Email, Hobby, Countries, Discipline and Preferred programming language.

No functions, loops, conditionals or any complex concepts.
Final print statement should print the organized output in a logical and understandable way.
Finally, create a simple video tutorial that includes all your team mates. Publish the video on linkedin.
ðŸ“šThe tasks covers the following Basics of Python:

Python Syntax
Python Data Types
Data Structures
âœ…Task Implementation We wrote a simple script to present the details of all team members in a structured tabular form. To achieve this;

We firstly collected the information of every member of the team as seen below: ##Team Members:
Name: Alo Yetunde Slack Username: MaryAde364 Email: aloyetunde99@gmail.com Hobby: Reading Country: Nigeria Discipline: Biochemistry Preferred Programming Language: Python

Name: Oluchi Bolanle Slack Username: Oluchi Bolanle Email: oluchibolanle@gmail.com Hobby: Journalling Country: Nigeria Discipline: Biochemistry Preferred Programming Language: Python

Name: Adewunmi Ifeoluwa Slack Username: Ifeoluwa Email: iadewunmi39@gmail.com Hobby: Reading Country: Nigeria Discipline: Physiology Preferred Programming Language: Python

Name: Adedayo Adeboye Slack Username: Adedayo Email: timsonad09@gmail.com Hobby: Playing games Country: Nigeria Discipline: Pharmacy Preferred Programming Language: Python

Name: Omojuwa Iyinoluwa Slack Username: Iyinomj Email: iyinomojuwa1@gmail.com Hobby: Cooking Country: Nigeria Discipline: Biotechnology Preferred Programming Language: Python

We created lists to be the header for the table and the required information were stored in each list as strings.

A varaible named "dataframe" was then created by making use of the f-string which allows for interpolation of variables and operations in a string.
The items in each string were accessed making use of their indexes and arranged making use of dashes and strokes to achieve a tabular format.
The final step was to print (dataframe).
