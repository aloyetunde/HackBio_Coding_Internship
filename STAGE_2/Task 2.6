Transcriptomics
This is a processed RNAseq dataset involving reading in quantitated gene expression data from an RNA-seq experiment, exploring the data using base Python functions and then interpretation. The dataset contains an experiment between a diseased cell line and diseased cell lines treated with compound X. The difference in expression change between the two health status is computed as Fold change to log 2 (Log2FC) and the significance of each is computed in p-value.

Task:
Generate a volcano plot. (Hint search for volcano plot online)

Determine the upregulated genes (Genes with Log2FC > 1 and pvalue < 0.01)

Determine the downregulated genes (Genes with Log2FC < -1 and pvalue < 0.01)

What are the functions of the top 5 upregulated genes and top 5 downregulated genes. (Use genecards)
